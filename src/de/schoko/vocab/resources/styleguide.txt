When writing a comment, start the line with #

A pair of vocabulary is structured like this:
word in first language - word in second language
The words need to be seperated by ' - '.
If you want to add multiple solutions, do it like this:
first solution in first language; second solution - word in second language
Of course this works on both sides.
If you want to have a 'fill in the gap'-Question, use the left side of the ' - ' to ask the question and replaced the word the solution should be with ' _ '.
The right side is the possible solutions for the gap. Currently there can only be one gap per question.
This is a cool example, I repeat: This is a  _  example. - cool

Full example:

# This was created by FooBar
welcome - willkommen
hello, hi, hey - hallo
nice - nett; freundlich
Willkommen means  _  in Englisch - welcome
