When writing a comment, start the line with #

A pair of vocabulary is structured like this:
word in first language - word in second language
The words need to be seperated by ' - '.
If you want to add multiple solutions, do it like this:
first solution in first language; second solution - word in second language
Of course this works on both sides

Full example:

# This was created by FooBar
welcome - willkommen
hello, hi, hey - hallo
nice - nett; freundlich
