Every vocab file needs to end with '.vocab'. Example:
vocabFile.txt

Every vocab file starts with '# Vocab'

If you need to write a comment, do it like this:
# Lorem ipsum dolore sit amet
The # needs to be the first character of the line (spaces before it are okay)

A pair of vocabulary is structured like this:
word in first language - word in second language
The words need to be seperated by ' - '.
If you want to add multiple solutions, do it like this:
first solution in first language; second solution - word in second language

Full example:

vocab101.txt

# Vocab
# This was created by FooBar
# First language: English
# Second language: German
welcome - willkommen
hello, hi, hey - hallo
nice - nett; freundlich
