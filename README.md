# Vocabulary

## About
**Vocabulary** is an open source java application for asking vocabulary from a self-entered source. It aims to give students a good way of learning vocabulary but it can also be used for other things.
Currently it's only used for german to french but support for other languages will be added soon.

### Features
- Asking Vocabulary with multiple correct options
- Vocab File Editor for creating your own vocabulary quizzes
- Performance rating (based on percentage of correct answers)
- 'Fill in the gap' questions

### Coming soon
- Language option for quizzes
- Several QoL updates

## Usage
This project currently requires Java 17.0.2 to be installed on your machine and on the path.
